##### Build Optimization

The CMake build system will, by default, create optimized _native_ builds for your particular system type when you build the software. Using this method, the binaries created provide a better experience and all-together faster performance.

##### Making Portable Binaries

However, if you wish to create _portable_ binaries that can be shared between systems, specify `-DARCH=default` in your CMake arguments during the build process. Note that _portable_ binaries will have a noticable difference in performance than _native_ binaries. For this reason, it is always best to build for your particular system if possible.
